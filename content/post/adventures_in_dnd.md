Lo, traveler! (*the fourth wall warps and dissipates*) I am the Cosmos. I will and it is. I speak and it is. Listen, and tremble...

That's how I'm kicking off my first D&D campaign ever. Some buddies of mine were wondering why we've never played Dungeons and Dragons together. I didn't have a good answer, and somehow I got volunteered to be the DM for our first adventure.

I don't mind it, and in fact, I think it'll be a lot fun. I'm just totally clueless about what constitutes a fun adventure and how to facilitate that experience as a DM.

So, I'm looking forward to it, and in the meantime, I'm doing all sorts of nerd research into DMing. I've been watching [Matt Colville's series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-YZvLUXcR8&list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_) on how to be a good dungeon master, and it's pretty solid. I'm impressed by his ability to just. keep. going. The dude's a machine when it comes to stream-of-consciousness delivery, and it's all remarkably coherent. Granted there's some editing involved, but the individual chunks of thought are still impressive.

I've also been checking out [Matt Mercer's videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT9570U87GhK_20NcbxM43vkom). He's best known for his role as dungeon master on [Critical Role](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT955Cw-fFS-_3IQvaCpQgDzWA), a D&D livestream that has received an overwhelmingly positive response from a broad audience, but his instructional content is also great.

They both raise some interesting points, and I may post some of my own thoughts on the topics they discuss in the future. For now, enjoy my very first player handout (CAUTION: it has some crude language):
