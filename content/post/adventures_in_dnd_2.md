So it finally happened. I dungeoned some dragons, and it was awesome. I'm happy to report it went much better than expected.

It was everyone's first time playing, and I had the idea to to do a one-shot adventure (an adventure that starts and ends in a single session) that would get everyone familiar with the rules and one another. However, I didn't want it to be a throw-away experience, so I framed the adventure as a historically significant event in the world of their campaign (which has yet to start). 

The story follows four characters that will one day become legends: 

 - **Bryn Qurocbasin**, a high elf Ranger from the Dretochtern mountains to the e`ast
 - **Kairon ibn Maltoc**, a tiefling Fighter wandering as a sword-for-hire
 - **Peren Siannodel**, a drow Rogue cast out from the Underdark
 - **Steven Austin**, a Paladin of Tyr setting out from Neverwinter and 

We meet the group just south of Neverwinter, where all four characters have been recruited to accompany a caravan to Phandalin. Ostensibly, each is in it for ten gold pieces. Truthfully, all but one has a secret agenda: The Deck of Many Things, the most powerful magical artifact known to mortal races. 

Bryn Qurocbasin must retrieve the Deck of Many Things. Bryn believes he is the rightful owner of The Deck, which was stolen from his father, Kedrin Qurocbasin, a hundred years before. Whether it *belonged* to his father is a different matter. Nonetheless, when Bryn hears rumors that the Deck has appeared in Phandalin, he joins the first group headed that direction.

Kairon ibn Maltoc must steal the Deck of Many Things. Burdened by the inescapable duality that is being a tiefling, Kairon's piteous childhood shone as a beacon to the Twin Gods of Truth and Deceit, Ar and Tal. In need of an errand boy among the mortals, they appeared to Kairon in a dream and quickly won his dedication. Now, the Twins seek the Deck, and they entrust their loyal servant to obtain it.

Peren Siannodel must destroy the Deck of Many Things. When the Drow murdered the extended family of Drizzt in retribution for his betrayal, only Kairon, second cousin of Drizzt, escaped. To seek revenge, Peren needed power. Thus, he sought the Archfey, the demigod patron of the elves of Serin Wood and the Drow's ardent enemy. After ritually projecting his soul before the Archfey, Kairon was granted power...with a catch. Now he serves the Archfey, and the Archfey rightly fears the Deck's power.

Steven Austin has no idea what the Deck of Many Things is. This half-elf do-gooder is a straight rip of Stone Cold Steve Austin with a paladin twist. He's out to kick some ass and look good doing it...er...make Tyr look good. With the blessing of the head Tyr'n prelate, Allota Vincetti McMahon, Steven sets out of Neverwinter to do good deeds and prosthelytize. Of course, Tyr'n paladins prosthelytize with a forty-pound warhammer and a mind full of strong opinions. 

Each has their purpose, and each is blessed with a mighty weapon:
