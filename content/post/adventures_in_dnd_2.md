We begin our journey with a dive into the history of our world, a tale of the not too distant past.

The story follows four men that will one day become legends: 

 - **Bryn Qurocbasin**, a high elf Ranger from the Dretochtern mountains to the east
 - **Kairon ibn Maltoc**, a tiefling Fighter wandering as a sword-for-hire
 - **Peren Siannodel**, a drow Rogue cast out from the Underdark
 - **Steven Austin**, a Paladin of Tyr setting out from Neverwinter 

We meet the group just south of Neverwinter, where all four have been recruited to accompany a caravan to Phandalin. The caravan's owner, Fallon, needs guards to protect his cargo and his son, Jonathan, who travels with the caravan. Ostensibly, each is in it for ten gold pieces. Truthfully, all but one has a secret agenda: The Deck of Many Things, the most powerful magical artifact known to mortal races. This common thread weaves the fates of four into a single pattern.

Bryn Qurocbasin must retrieve the Deck of Many Things. Bryn believes he is the rightful owner of The Deck, which was stolen from his father, Kedrin Qurocbasin, a hundred years before. Whether it *belonged* to his father is a different matter. Nonetheless, when Bryn hears rumors that the Deck has appeared in Phandalin, he joins the first group headed in that direction.

Kairon ibn Maltoc must steal the Deck of Many Things. Burdened by the inescapable duality that is being a tiefling, Kairon's piteous childhood shone as a beacon to the Twin Gods of Truth and Deceit. In need of an errand boy among the mortals, they appeared to Kairon in a dream and quickly won his dedication. Now, the Twins seek the Deck, and they entrust their loyal servant to obtain it.

Peren Siannodel must destroy the Deck of Many Things. When the Drow murdered the extended family of Drizzt in retribution for his betrayal, only Peren escaped. To seek revenge, Peren needed power. Thus, he sought the Archfey, the demigod patron of the elves of Serin Wood and the Drow's ardent enemy. Ritually projecting his soul before the Archfey, Kairon was granted power, with a catch. Now he serves the Archfey, and the Archfey rightly fears the Deck's power.

Steven Austin has no idea what the Deck of Many Things is. This half-elf do-gooder is a straight rip of Stone Cold Steve Austin with a paladin twist. He's out to kick ass and look good...er...make Tyr look good. With the blessing of the head Tyr'n prelate, Allota Vincetti McMahon, Steven sets out of Neverwinter to do good deeds and prosthelytize. Of course, Tyr'n paladins prosthelytize with a forty-pound warhammer and a mind full of strong opinions. 

Each has their purpose, and each is blessed with a mighty weapon:

So they set out, and soon after leaving Neverwinter, the group tests their mettle. The road to Phandalin is well-traveled, and suspecting no danger, the caravan does not scout ahead. This proves to be a mistake. Although Bryn and Peren take turns standing guard as the rest of the group sleeps, they are too slow to wake Steven and Kairon as goblin marauders beset them. 

Taken by surprise, Steven and Kairon are forced to fight in the nude, desperately hoping to avoid a fatal arrow from the goblin archers hiding in the brush. Peren engages the hobgoblins charging the caravan, while Bryn returns fire on the goblin archers. Luckily, they hold them off long enough for Kairon to rally. As Steven bumbles sleepily about, Kairon jumps to his feet and blinds a group of goblin archers, immolating their cover with a bolt of fire. In the resulting confusion, Bryn picks them off with the perfect accuracy of the Qurocbasin bow. Peren continues to stifle the onslaught of the hobgoblins, but is injured as they flank him. Just then, Steven groggily rushes into the battle, invoking the power of Tyr to heal Peren's wound. Together they finish off the hobgoblins before the naked Steven returns to cover. 

With the hobgoblins removed, the group focuses their attention on the few remaining archers. Peren expertly harries them, throwing his enchanted dagger as Bryn and Kairon clean house with a hail of acid and arrows. Unfortunately, the rally is not a perfect success. They kill the last of the goblins, but the smell of urine overwhelms the stench of unwashed goblin corpses. Following the scent, the group finds an injured Jonathan hiding behind the caravan. Jonathan is shot through the leg and cursing up a storm. His pants are soaked, and he has the look of horror that plagues the unitiated combatant. Calming him, Steven treats the wound, and the group finally gets some rest.

The rest is a troubled one. Each of the four adventurers' nights are filled with strange, vivid dreams. Common amongst these dreams is the gaze of huge blue eyes that reveal an otherwise invisible observer. The focus of these eyes is matched only by their intensity, and as the dreamer turns to meet the gaze, they feel as though they are fully awake, standing face to face with the ineffable. 

Bryn dreams of his son, grown and bowed in defeat; Kairon dreams of an unfamiliar face, runes scrawled in pink scars, and glowing purple eyes; Peren dreams of a young wood Elf carrying his knives with a curious familiarity; and Steven dreams of a Tyr'n paladin, large in stature and carrying an unknown banner. Although the newly forged group does not share these dreams with one another, the current of time carries all tales.

As they break camp, the caravan spots a glint of blue streaking across the sky. Not sure what to make of it, and unsettled by the night's dreams, no one says a word. 

The days pass uneventfully, and within the week, the caravan arrives at Phandalin. Jonathan pays the adventurers as they head into the Wellspring Inn to rest and gather information. Steven retreats to his room for his nightly prayers. The rest head to the inn's bar and begin searching for clues to the whereabouts of the Deck of Many Things, Bryn in the open and Peren and Kairon more discreetly. Overhearing discussion of the Deck, a toothless drunk at the end of the bar begins mumbling loudly. In between gibberish, the three make out the words "dragon-people" and "Thundertree." Bryn approaches him openly and buys him a drink; he is not shy when asking about his stolen property. In his own way, the drunk is happy to tell his tale. His tale, however, is mostly gibberish and sobs about his recently murdered wife. Without revealing his ulterior motives, Kairon offers Bryn his help and begins to hatch a plan.

As the drunk continues to mumble to Bryn and Kairon, Peren sneaks what appears to be the deed to a house and a sketch of a woman from the drunk's pouch. Peren bores of the situation and takes a look around the room. At first, nothing seems amiss. No one is behaving strangely or giving any indication that they might know something about the Deck. However, Peren notices that two patrons have left, and by the looks of it, their departure was hasty. Unable to recall who it was that had occupied the now empty seats, Peren makes his way into the night. A drow, Peren easily follows their tracks in the moonlight and catches sight of them just as they enter the fields north of Phandalin. Peren masks his presence well enough to trail within ear-shot of the two men. Thus, he hears them clearly as they discuss how they murdered the drunk's wife and swear to do the same to the drunk "if he keeps running his mouth." As Peren continues to follow them, he notices a distinct symbol adorning the helmet of one of the travelers. Unable to make a useful sketch of the symbol, Peren risks an encounter to snatch the pouch off of the visibly-more-drunken of the two. As he inspects the contents, he finds an iron token emblazoned with the same symbol that he had seen on the helmet. In the moonlight the symbol resembles an abstract depiction of a dragon's head. The two men continue into the woods north of the fields as Peren returns to Phandalin.

Kairon sets to work pressing the old drunk for information. At first he uses the Arentalasverth to conjure a buxom woman, hoping that the old man can be roused from his stupor. While this does cheer the old man, his focus waivers too much for him to impart anything useful. Kairon pulls Bryn aside and reveals a brilliant strategy: they will use the old man's grief as a lever. They follow the old man to his home, insisting to bystanders that they'd like to make sure he makes it back safely. Their true intentions are more nefarious. Once the old man settles into bed, Kairon summons a ghastly illusion that passes for the haunted soul of a deceased woman. Kairon wakes the old man from his slumber by conjuring some noise from outside the house. Kairon then manipulates the illusion to confront the old man, immitating his deceased wife and begging him for vengeance. The old man's grief strikes true, and for a moment, sobriety courses through his veins like ice water. He begs for forgiveness, wails at his failure as a husband, and with the passion of the dying, promises his wife that he will get vengeance. Satisfied, the spectre tells him to approach the adventurers in the morning and tell them everything. Then, she disappears. The old man falls to his knees, staring at the spot where his wife stood, and sobs heavily until sleep takes him.

All the while, Peren sneaks into the blacksmith's shop, hoping to forge a copy of the stolen coin. He passes the smithy's locks easily enough; however, the sight and sound of his forging catches the attention of the blacksmith, whose enlarged prostate often forces a midnight wee. The blacksmith enters the smithy and charges Peren, who disposes of him with a single stroke of his knife. Peren formulates a plan to get rid of the body. He creates a copy of the deed to the drunk's home as well as a false letter of threat addressed to the drunk by the blacksmith. Then, Peren sneaks the corpse into the drunk's home and leaves it with the forged documents. 

As Peren walks away from a disaster neatly averted, the sun rises above the horizon. Turning toward the inn, Peren bumps into Kairon, Bryn, and Steven. Each questions the others before they're interrupted by a scream emanating from the drunk's home. They enter to see him standing over the blacksmith's corpse. The drunk is in shock, unable to recall murdering the blacksmith or even a motive. Peren interjects and suggests that the drunk skip town for a little while. This puts Bryn and Kairon at unease until the drunk recalls his encounter with his wife's spectre the night before. He agrees that he should probably leave, but feels obligated to help them at his wife's suggestion. Thus the drunk tells them of how his wife was murdered, her never-touched deck of cards, and how her body was still warm when he realized that only the deck had been stolen. He couldn't stop the assailants, but he did see them heading north in the direction of Thundertree, a city recently ruined by a rogue dragon. Furthermore, he describes a symbol on their helmets that matches the one Peren observed.

The group sets off with the drunk, eager for revenge, toward Thundertree. Bryn uses his longstrider magic to increase the speed of the drunk to match their own, and the newly formed group approaches Thundertree quickly. Once they are near enough, they begin to travel cautiously, staying just inside the edge of the nearby woods. As they wait for sundown, the group spots two men leaving Thundertree. Peren recognizes one of them, and the group decides to take a hostage. They ambush the two men from the trees. With a single blow, Steven smashes the head of the first like a watermelon. Bryn immobilizes the second with a well-placed arrow. Questioning the survivor, they learn that a group of dragon cultists now occupies Thundertree. The cultists have sworn allegiance to a young green dragon, Sentradonix, that has promised to transform them all into dragonborn. The captured cultist tells them the locations of the guards, the dragon's lair, and how they might go about distracting the encampment.

Following the captive's suggestion, Bryn and Peren make a ruckus at the edge of the forest to the east of Thundertree. Apparently, wood elves have been harassing the cultists' encampment for weeks. An alarm is raised, and the cultists rush to defend. As this occurs, Bryn and Peren return to the group unnoticed. Leaving the old man behind for safety, the four of them sprint for the dragon's lair while the commotion lasts. They approach the building under which the dragon roosts. Peren spots a small crack in the wall that is large enough to fit through. He goes in and reports back to the others that it appears to enter the dragon's lair. 

They all enter carefully, but some more carefully than others. 

Steven stumbles, falls, and creates a loud noise that echoes through the chamber. The treasure that litters the floor can be heard shifting under the weight of something large. 

Sentradonix speaks: "I wasn't expecting visitors. What brings you four to my home?"

As the four adventurers get their bearings, they see the large shape slither past them, settling in the gap between themselves and the exit. At this distance it is clear they are face to face with a young dragon. Peren tries to dawdle and feel out the situation. He makes conversation with the dragon, but tempers flare. No one recalls who makes the first attack, but the results are devastating. Sentradonix sprays a cone of poisonous fluid, rendering Peren and Bryn unconscious. Steven and Kairon are on the periphery of the cone and avoid the bulk of the blast. They are, however, unequivocally outmatched. Sentradonix lashes out at Kairon, badly wounding him. Steven manages to stabilize Peren in the heat of battle, but there is no hope of victory.

Just as the adventurers prepare for death, a blue flash blinds them, and the lair's walls and ceiling explode outward. An enormous dragon stands atop Sentradonix, pinning his neck beneath a large blue claw. On closer inspection, the glittering blue skin is in fact sapphires; the dragon is covered in them. From its neck dangle five strange tentacles, but more striking still are its eyes. They are the same piercing blue eyes that plagued their dreams only a few nights ago. The sapphire dragon, maybe four or five times larger than Sentradonix, speaks with a loud booming voice:

"I apologize for this young one."

Sentradonix makes a horrible hiss at this, and the sapphire dragon crushes his throat, silencing him.

"He has embarassed our kind for the last time."

Bryn finally sits up, conscious, and the group waits motionless as the huge sapphire eyes study them.

"Four Ta'veren. All in one place. Strong Ta'veren too. So similar. Hm... but you are not the ones I seek."

The dragon pauses. Its mouth curls into a horrifying smile, each tooth as large as a man. 

"Yes. I see. You are the ones who come before. Yes, yes. I have followed the right thread to the wrong time, it seems. Well, the wheel weaves as the wheel wills. Yes, you are the ones who come before. In which case, you have much to do. I believe this is what you came here for?"

The dragon tilts its head inquisitively as a small wooden box floats into the air before them. Bryn, Peren, and Kairon are transfixed on the box, eyes wide. They recognize the Deck and are frozen to the spot, incredulous. Steven looks between the three of them not realizing that ten feet away is the world's most powerful magical artifact. 

"Oh!" the dragon exclaims. "I should plant my name. Yes, they should know I'm coming. Tell them my name is Matronix. Tell them..." 

Matronix's grin fades to an emotionless mask.

"...I am coming."

With another blue flash the sapphire dragon is gone. All at once the box begins to fall to the ground. Bryn, Peren, and Kairon throw themselves at the spot where it will land. As they struggle for possession, Sentradonix's head turns to them. A furious, pained voice hisses at them.

"You fools."

Unaware of Sentradonix, the three continue to wrestle for the Deck. Sentradonix shifts his weight onto one arm, lifting his fatally wounded neck off the floor.

"They don't listen. They never listen."

Steven rushes at Bryn, Peren, and Kairon who continue their violent squabble, failing to notice the imminent danger. Just as Sentradonix releases a dying, venomous breath, Bryn emerges from the pile holding the box high over his head only to be tackled back onto the pile by Steven, a warding prayer in his throat. The force of the breath at close range sends Steven skidding over the treasure-covered floor like a stone skipped on water. His limbs twist and snap. Miraculously, an invisible barrier parts the spray around the group of three, huddled in a tangle of arms and legs. The barrier fades, and the glaze of death forms a beautiful patina on the yellow eyes of the now-stiff corpse of Sentradonix.

The mass of adventurers untangles. Bryn looks down at his empty hands. He panics, searching left and right. 

"I don't see it. I don't see it!"

The Deck is gone. Peren walks to the place where Steven is lying. He kneels and touches his hand to Steven's neck.

"He's dead."

Bryn and and Kairon turn to him. Looking more closely, Peren notices something in Steven's mouth. Hoping to leave the body in a dignifed state, Peren pulls the detritus from Steven's mouth.

"This is..."

The face of a card is burned into Peren's mind, and in that instant his hand is empty. Behind him Kairon is distracted by what appears to be a card in the rubble where they had struggled. He bends down, turning the card over as he lifts it from the ground. Kairon's eyes go wide as the card vanishes. 

Bryn sighs.

"Well, I suppose it goes without saying that we all came for the same reason."

He pauses, looking in the direction of Steven's corpse.

"Except for Steven, that is."

He pauses again. No one acknowledges that he is speaking.

"Johnny Crust, I can't believe he jumped in there like that. I suppose he really *was* just a decent man trying to do right." 

With these words, Bryn snatches his pouch off the ground. Noticing an unfamiliar lightness to the pouch, Bryn opens it to discover a single card. He holds the card in the light now pouring in from where the ceiling once arched. As quickly as his eyes can focus on its image, the card is gone. 

The three men remain unmoving, stunned by the powerful magics winding through the air and passing through their bodies. In their silence, there is an understanding. Staring at their empty hands, the three men know that their world is forever changed.

So begins the legend of the three. So ends the legend of the one that was lost.
