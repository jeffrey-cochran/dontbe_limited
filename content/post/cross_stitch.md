Yo! Since cross-stitching is one of the hobbies that has inadvertently gotten me interested in some cool applied mathematics, I figured I might as well share some of the cross-stitching I do.

To kick it off, do note the wicked Poliwhirl embroidery I did for the lead-in photo. I've been doing a series of Pokemon-themed hats for Christmas gifts this (last?) year. I finished my first one in early December, decided it looked !@#$ing dope, and committed myself making all my friends one.

It turns out that was a little ambitious. They take forever, and I'm still not done halfway through January. I am, however, making progress. I just finished this Magneton on a Lids' flex-fit cap for my buddy:

 I still have at least four or five more to go, but I suspect that if they're a hit, I'll probably have to make one for all the folks I didn't manage to see over Christmas break. Thank god I don't have enough charisma to charm more than ten friends.

 So, what cool mathematics has cross-stitching turned me onto? A lot. First and foremost, cross-stitching has gotten me really interested in image quantization. As you can see, pixel art makes for awesome cross-stitch patterns. So my immediate thought was, "How do I turn stuff into cool pixel art?" Fundamentally, that's what I've been pondering the last few weeks, but as a part of that, I've begun doing a deep dive into image quantization techniques. It's a big field, but I've managed to track down a few papers that were interesting enough to implement for my own purposes, and I think I'll convert the finished product into a few PyPi modules and a webapp.

 I'll do a series of posts on those papers. In the meantime, if you like the Pokemon patterns I've been using, you can purchase them from [Fangirl Stitches on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/198488910/gotta-catch-em-all-151-original-pokemon).
